## Gap

Fill holes in your programs using LLMs. Inspired by [Victor's scripts](https://github.com/VictorTaelin/AI-scripts) and intended to be used in an editor buffer. Holes designated by `{{FILL_HERE}}` are replaced on a best-effort basis by the AI API

```javascript
function cube(x) {
  {{FILL_HERE}}
}
```
